#### This music website project was built by me and [Yihua](https://github.com/luvnico) for course Web Front End Development, which showed the music, Zumba videos and concerts that we want to share. 

#### We use these tech stacks:
* HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery were used for index page.
* jQuery DataTable plugin was used to display the music lists.
* WaveSurfer.js library was used for the music player.(We tried to use SoundCloud API, but it looks like SoundCloud will not provide it anymore)
* We used Google Firebase Database to store each song's comments submitted by users.
